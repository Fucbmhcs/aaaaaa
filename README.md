# PowerDownBot
 PowerDown is a python discord bot fully coded by me. It allows you since discord to launch ddos ​​attacks. The script connects to the attack servers and launches the ddos ​​scripts with the parameters entered by the user from the discord bot.

# Requirements

- You need to install python module discord and paramiko : `sudo pip3 install discord && sudo pip3 install paramiko`.
- You need a bot with her token, put the token in the code.
- And change the code for the emplacement of your ddos script and put the login of your attack server in the code.
